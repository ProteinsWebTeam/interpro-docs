The InterPro 7 logo on the right-hand side of the website banner has a dual
purpose. It links to the :doc:`/homepage` and also displays an animation whilst data
is being loaded to indicate that the page being viewed has not fully loaded.

The *magnifying glass* icon on the left side of website banner can be clicked
to show a text entry component. A search can be triggered by entering some text
and pressing the enter/return key or the clicking the magnifying glass. This is
the same as using the text search in the :doc:`/searchpage`

The *hamburger* icon on the right opens the settings sidebar.

The settings sidebar provides another way to access different parts of the
website and is the only way of accessing the settings page.

The **Connection Status** section of the sidebar provides a visual *traffic light*
overview of the status of a number of resources the website relies upon. The
details of what each traffic light represents can be viewed by hovering the
mouse pointer over the light.
