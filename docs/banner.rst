The InterPro 7 logo on the right-hand side of the website banner has a dual
purpose. It links to the :doc:`/homepage` and also displays an animation whilst
data is being fetched from servers to indicate that the not all components on
the page being viewed have completely loaded.

The *magnifying glass* icon on the left side of website banner can be clicked
to show a text entry component. A search can be triggered by entering some text
and pressing the enter/return key or the clicking the magnifying glass. This is
the same as using the text search in the :doc:`/searchpage`

The **Connection Status** section of the sidebar provides a visual *traffic light*
overview of the status of a number of resources the website relies upon. The
details of what each traffic light represents can be viewed by hovering the
mouse pointer over the light.
