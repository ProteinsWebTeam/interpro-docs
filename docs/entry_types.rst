InterPro Entry Types
####################

******
Domain
******

Domains are distinct functional, structural or sequence units that may exist in
a variety of biological contexts. A match to an InterPro entry of this type
indicates the presence of a domain

******
Family
******

A protein family is a group of proteins that share a common evolutionary origin
reflected by their related functions, similarities in sequence, or similar
primary, secondary or tertiary structure. A match to an InterPro entry of this
type indicates membership of a protein family.

**********************
Homologous Superfamily
**********************

A homologous superfamily is a group of proteins that share a common evolutionary
origin, reflected by similarity in their structure. Since superfamily members
often display very low similarity at the sequence level, this type of InterPro
entry is usually based on a collection of underlying hidden Markov models,
rather than a single signature.

******
Repeat
******

A short sequence that is typically repeated within a protein.

****
Site
****

InterPro contains data for the following types of sites.

Active
======

A short sequence that contains one or more conserved residues, which allow the
protein to bind to a ligand.

Binding
=======

A short sequence that contains one or more conserved residues, which form a
protein interaction site.

Conserved
=========

A short sequence that contains one or more conserved residues, which form a
protein interaction site.

PTM
===

A short sequence that contains one or more conserved residues.
Post-translational modification site.
