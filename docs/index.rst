InterPro
========
InterPro is a resource that provides functional analysis of protein sequences by
classifying them into families and predicting the presence of domains and
important sites. InterPro uses predictive models, known as signatures, to
classify proteins. The signatures are provided by several different databases
(referred to as member databases) that make up the InterPro consortium.
