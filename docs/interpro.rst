InterPro is a resource that provides functional analysis of protein sequences 
by classifying them into families and predicting the presence of domains and 
important sites. To classify proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive 
models, known as signatures, provided by several collaborating databases 
(referred to as member databases) that collectively make up the InterPro 
consortium. A key value of InterPro is that it combines protein signatures 
from these member databases into a single searchable resource, capitalising 
on their individual strengths to produce a powerful integrated database and 
diagnostic tool. We add further value to InterPro entries by providing detailed 
functional annotation as well as adding relevant GO terms that enable automatic 
annotation of millions of GO terms across the protein sequence databases. 

InterPro integrates signatures from the following 13 member databases:

CATH, CDD, HAMAP, MobiDB Lite, Panther, Pfam, PIRSF, PRINTS, Prosite, SFLD, SMART, 
SUPERFAMILY AND NCBIfam (the :doc:`InterPro consortium </databases>` section gives 
further information about the individual databases).

The member databases use a variety of different methods to classify proteins. 
Each of the databases has a particular focus (e.g. protein domains defined from 
structure, or full length protein families with shared function). We strive to 
integrate the signatures from the member databases into InterPro entries and 
to identify where different member database entries are the same entity.

You can use the `InterPro website <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/>`_ to obtain information about individual protein 
families, domains, important sites, perform a sequence search or browse through 
InterPro annotations. We have designed the website to be intuitive for new users 
meaning it is not essential to read this documentation. However, in the following 
sections you will find a wealth of specialised and powerful features that can be 
easily overlooked. You may also want to check out our list of :doc:`training materials 
and webinars </tutorials_webinars>`.

InterPro is updated approximately every 8 weeks. The `release notes page <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/release_notes/>`_ 
contains information about what has changed in each release.

All information in InterPro is freely available. You can download InterPro data 
for local analyses from the :ref:`Download <bulk_download>` page, or use the :ref:`InterPro API <api>`. Find out more 
about the project by exploring the :doc:`latest papers </citing>`.
