InterProScan is the software package that allows sequences to be scanned against InterPro's 
member database signatures.

Users who have novel nucleotide or protein sequences that they wish to functionally 
characterise can use InterProScan to run the scanning algorithms against the InterPro 
database in an integrated way.
