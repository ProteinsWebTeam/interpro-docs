About PRINTS
########

PRINTS is a compendium of protein fingerprints. A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family; 
its diagnostic power is refined by iterative scanning of a SwissProt/TrEMBL composite. Usually the motifs do not overlap, but are 
separated along a sequence, though they may be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can encode protein folds and functionalities more 
flexibly and powerfully than can single motifs, full diagnostic potency deriving from the mutual context provided by motif neighbours.

The PRINTS database was previously hosted at the University of Manchester Bioinformatics Education and Research, but has been retired 
and InterPro serves as an archive for this resource.
