The Structure-Function Linkage Database (`SFLD <http://sfld.rbvi.ucsf.edu/archive/django/index.html>`_) is a hierarchical 
classification of enzymes that relates specific sequence-structure features to specific chemical capabilities. It was 
developed by the Babbitt Laboratory in collaboration with the UCSF Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics. 
As of April 2019, the database is in static format, and will not be updated.
